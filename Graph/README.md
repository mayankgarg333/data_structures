## Graph is created using adjacency list.

Graph is created for implementation of different graph algorithms. Adjacency list is used. A node can also store other data like color and distance. 

Good use of pointers. 


## BFS is implemented using the graph created previously

Awesome implementation of BFS using adjacency list. Code also prints graph, minimum distance for difference nodes and previous node. Code can be used for other algorithms. 


## DFS is implemented using the graph created previously

DFS algorithm implemented. Different paths can be traced using prevNode and start-finish timestamps.
